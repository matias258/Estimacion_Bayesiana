"2","Warning: `fitted_draws` and `add_fitted_draws` are deprecated as their names were confusing.
- Use [add_]epred_draws() to get the expectation of the posterior predictive.
- Use [add_]linpred_draws() to get the distribution of the linear predictor.
- For example, you used [add_]fitted_draws(..., scale = ""response""), which
  means you most likely want [add_]epred_draws(...).
NOTE: When updating to the new functions, note that the `model` parameter is now
  named `object` and the `n` parameter is now named `ndraws`."
